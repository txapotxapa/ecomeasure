## 1. Canopy Cover Analysis for Gap Light Measurement

- GPS coordinates recorded for each measurement location

#### 1.1.2 Processing Algorithms

**Standard Method Implementation:**
The standard algorithm calculates the Canopy Cover (CaCo) index using artificial horizon masking and zenith angle weighting:

```
CaCo = Σ(gap_pixels × cos(zenith_angle)) / Σ(total_pixels × cos(zenith_angle))
```

**Advanced Method Implementation:**
The advanced algorithm uses color ratio analysis for vegetation detection:
- Green ratio: G/(R+G+B)
- Blue ratio: B/(R+G+B)
